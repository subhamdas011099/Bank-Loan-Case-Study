# Bank-Loan-Case-Study
In this project I have done a bank loan case study. The primary objective of this project is to use EDA (exploratory data analysis) to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default. I have used ms exel to complete the entire project. 
(Note :- The working files are very large so I have uploaded them in google drive and I have shared the link.)
